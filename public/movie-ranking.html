<h2>Top 3 Video Games of all time</h2>
<h3>1. The Witcher 3</h3>
<p>After playing through this game twice I can say this world is one of the most liveable I have ever experienced.</p>
<h3>2. Hogwarts Legacy</h3>
<p>The ability to roam free in the world of Harry Potter brings to life some of the most cherished memories of my youth. Nostalgia coupled with the graphical beauty of this game brings me so much enjoyment.</p>
<h3>3. GTA Franchise</h3>
<p>From playing this for the first time in 2000 on a gameboy color, to playing GTA 5 on a playstation 5. GTA truely gripped my imagination and immersed me in the open world genre. This game is the ultimate free roam experience.</p>
